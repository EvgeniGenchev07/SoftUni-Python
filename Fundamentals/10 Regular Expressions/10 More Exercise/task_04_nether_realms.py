################################################   Task Description   ################################################
# 4. Nether Realms
# Mighty battle is coming. In the stormy nether realms, demons are fighting against each other
# for supremacy in a duel from which only one will survive.
# Your job, however is not so exciting.
# You are assigned to sign in all the participants in the nether realm's mighty battle's demon book,
# which of course is sorted alphabetically.
# A demon's name contains his health and his damage.
# The sum of the asci codes of all characters (excluding numbers (0-9),
# arithmetic symbols ('+', '-', '*', '/') and delimiter dot ('.')) gives a demon's total health.
# The sum of all numbers in his name forms his base damage.
# Note that you should consider the plus '+' and minus '-' signs (e.g. +10 is 10 and -10 is -10).
# However, there are some symbols ('*' and '/') that can further alter the base damage
# by multiplying or dividing it by 2 (e.g. in the name "m15*/c-5.0", the base damage is 15 + (-5.0) = 10
# and then you need to multiply it by 2 (e.g. 10 * 2 = 20) and then divide it by 2 (e.g. 20 / 2 = 10)).
# So, multiplication and division are applied only after all numbers are included in the calculation
# and in the order they appear in the name.
# You will get all demons on a single line, separated by commas and zero or more blank spaces.
# Sort them in alphabetical order and print their names along their health and damage.
# Input
# The input will be read from the console.
# The input consists of a single line containing all demon names separated by commas and zero or more spaces
# in the format: "{demon name}, {demon name}, … {demon name}"
# Output
# Print all demons sorted by their name in ascending order, each on a separate line in the format:
# • "{demon name} - {health points} health, {damage points} damage"
# Constraints
# • A demon's name will contain at least one character
# • A demon's name cannot contain blank spaces ' ' or commas ','
# • A floating point number will always have digits before and after its decimal separator
# • Number in a demon's name is considered everything that is a valid integer
# or floating point number (with dot '.' used as separator).
# For example, all these are valid numbers: '4', '+4', '-4', '3.5', '+3.5', '-3.5'
