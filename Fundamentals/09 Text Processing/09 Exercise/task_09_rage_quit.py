# ################################################   Task Description   ################################################
# 9. *Rage Quit
# Every gamer knows what rage-quitting means.
# It's when you're just not good enough, and you blame everybody else for losing a game -
# you press the CAPS LOCK key on the keyboard and flood the chat with gibberish to show your frustration.
# Peter is a gamer, a bad one. When he rage-quits, he wants to be the most annoying kid on his team;
# he wants something truly spectacular. He asks for your help.
# He'll give you a series of strings (containing only non-numerical characters)
# followed by non-negative numbers (N), e.g., "a3".
# You need to convert the letters to uppercase for each string and print it repeatedly N times on the console.
# In the example, you need to write back "AAA".
# First, on the output, you should print a statistic of the number of unique symbols used (case-insensitive)
# in the format: "Unique symbols used {0}".
# Next, print the rage message itself.
# The strings and numbers will not be separated by anything.
# The input will always start with a non-numeric symbol, and for each string, there will be a corresponding number.
# The input will be given on a single line.
# Input
# • The input data should be read from the console.
# • It consists of a single line holding a series of string-number sequences.
# • The input data will always be valid. There is no need to check it explicitly.
# Output
# • The output should be printed on the console. It should consist of exactly two lines:
#     o On the first line, print the number of unique symbols used in the message in the format described above.
#     o On the second line, print the rage message.
# Constraints
# • The count of string-number pairs will be in the range [1 … 20 000].
# • Each string will contain any character except digits. The length of each string will be in the range [1 … 20].
# • The repeat count for each string will be an integer in the range [0 … 20].
# • Allowed working time for your program: 0.3 seconds. Allowed memory: 64 MB.
